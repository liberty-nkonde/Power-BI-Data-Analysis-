### Imporatnt Notes
* In this project we were using a free edition of Power BI so there are a lot of missing features that couldn't be demonstrated here. 
* [canvas Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards) are available only in Power BI Service that require license fees.
* Power BI requires license fees according to the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/service-get-started) so we couldn't use its features. 
* `Train.html` isn't part of the project it's for reference only.
* Because the free version of Power BI is limited in functionality the dashboards doesn't cover all visualization types such as UniVariate and MultiVariate visualizations, for more advanced visuals check out [Data Visualization Project](https://github.com/YousefSaber/Visualization-Project).
